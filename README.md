# WHY

I have always liked writing bash scripts. Hence I have always had well-maintained bash aliases. They are sweet, they speed up and ease my daily routines!
I am now happy to share them with you! Don't hesitate to get in touch, and even to fork it :)

# FEATURES

To get the full list of added "aliases", type manalias in your command line

`manlias`

There are numerous features :

## Some for your daily life.
The ones I use the most are :
- *c* and its derivates (cc, .., ...) - a magic 'cd' function
- *g* - find a word into any files from current directory, recursive
- *f* - an easy to use quick find alias
- *l* 
- *youdl* - download a music from a youtube link straight in my most recent music sub-directory


## Some others are specific for development
*tf* - print the line added to a log, like error logs
*copast* - in git, to checkout the last branch you were into
*checkout* (or co) - properly checkout, killing any gulp process to avoid any gulp mess

# CAUTIOUS :
The file named "justforme.sh" is actually a set of commands and aliases just for me.

*please delete the file named justforme.sh*

# HOW TO :

add this lines at the end of your ~/.bashrc file :

```
. ~/baal-bash-alias/_main.sh

```
